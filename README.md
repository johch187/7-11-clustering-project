# 7-11-clustering-project
My term project was to cluster all the 7/11 in Xinyi and find a good assignment for personnel of a business problem, This was done using k-means-clustering and then using 2-opt TSP to find the most efficient route in each cluster. 

The data was gathered online using addresses, converted to long, lat, and then used in clustering.
